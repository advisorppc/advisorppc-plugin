## Overview

AdvisorPPC connects Claude Code to the accounts a performance marketer actually
works in. Once connected, Claude can pull live data, run structured audits, and
— on paid plans — manage budgets and campaigns, all under your plan's
permissions and quotas.

This repository is the official distribution point for the plugin. It contains
the plugin manifest, the marketplace definition, and the bundled skills. The
connector itself runs as a hosted service at `mcp.advisorppc.com`, operated by
Advisor Media.

## Capabilities

| Area | What Claude can do |
| --- | --- |
| **Google Ads** | Account and campaign audits, wasted-spend analysis, search-term review, recommendations, change history; budget and campaign management on paid plans |
| **Google Analytics 4** | Traffic and conversion reporting, cross-channel performance context |
| **Search Console** | Query and page performance, indexing insight for organic-vs-paid analysis |
| **Tag Manager** | Container and tag setup inspection |
| **YouTube** | Channel and video performance review |

## What's in the box

- **Remote MCP server** (`advisorppc`) — the hosted connector at
  `https://mcp.advisorppc.com/claude`. Authentication is browser OAuth on first
  use; credentials never live in your config files.
- **Skills** that teach Claude proven, repeatable workflows:
  - `google-ads-audit` — structured account and campaign audits: baseline,
    wasted spend, search terms, recommendations, change history.
  - `ppc-reporting` — cross-platform performance reports over Ads, Analytics,
    Search Console, and YouTube.
  - `getting-connected` — first-run setup, plans and quotas, troubleshooting.

## Install

From the terminal:

```
claude plugin marketplace add advisorppc/advisorppc-plugin
claude plugin install advisorppc@advisorppc
```

Or interactively inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add advisorppc/advisorppc-plugin
/plugin install advisorppc@advisorppc
```

## First run

1. Install the plugin and start a new Claude Code session.
2. Run `/mcp` — the `advisorppc` server appears; connecting it opens OAuth
   sign-in in your browser.
3. Approve the connection, then link the Google account that has access to
   your ad accounts.
4. Ask Claude to list your accounts to confirm everything works.

## Plans

| Plan | Includes |
| --- | --- |
| **Free** | 100 tool calls per month, read-only tools — periodic audits and reports |
| **Paid** | Write tools (budget and campaign management) and higher quotas |

Current plans and pricing: [advisorppc.com](https://advisorppc.com).

## Security

- All product code runs server-side in the hosted connector; this repository
  contains only manifests and documentation — no executable server code and no
  secrets.
- Authentication is OAuth 2.1 in your own browser. The plugin never asks for,
  stores, or transmits API keys or passwords through configuration files.
- Every write operation is plan-gated and quota-enforced server-side.

To report a vulnerability, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Troubleshooting

Opening `https://mcp.advisorppc.com/claude` directly in a browser returns
**401 — this is expected**: it is an MCP endpoint, not a web page. For anything
else, see the `getting-connected` skill bundled with this plugin, the
[docs](https://advisorppc.com/docs), or [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md).
