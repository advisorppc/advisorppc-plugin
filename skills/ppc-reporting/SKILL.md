# Cross-Platform PPC Reporting

Pull performance reports from the signed-in user's own accounts across Google Ads, Google Analytics 4, Search Console, and YouTube using the AdvisorPPC connector. All tools are read-only.

## Reporting workflow

1. Pin the reporting period first (for example last 30 days, or a named month). Use the same period across every platform in one report.
2. Discover the right resource IDs before reporting (each platform has its own discovery tool — see below).
3. Pull each platform's report, then merge into one narrative: paid performance → site behavior → organic search → video.
4. Present real numbers with period-over-period deltas where available. Monetary values are in the account's own currency.

## Tools by platform

### Google Ads (paid performance)

- Discovery: `ga_list_accessible_customers_tool`, then `ga_list_customer_clients_tool` for MCC client accounts.
- `ga_account_performance_tool` — account-level rollup for a `date_range`.
- `ga_campaign_performance_tool` — cost-sorted campaign rows.
- `ga_keyword_performance_tool` — keyword-level traffic, cost, and CPA (`min_impressions` filters noise).
- `ga_search_terms_report_tool` — actual queries that generated paid traffic.

### Google Analytics 4 (site behavior)

- Discovery: `ga4_list_properties_tool` — property IDs, names, currencies.
- `ga4_run_report_tool` — general reports: pass `property_id`, `metrics`, `dimensions`, `date_ranges`, `limit`.
- `ga4_traffic_by_source_tool` — source/medium rows with users, sessions, conversions for the last `days`.
- `ga4_realtime_tool` — current active users, for "is the site getting traffic right now".
- `ga4_list_key_events_tool` — which conversion events the property actually measures; check this before reporting "conversions" from GA4.

### Search Console (organic search)

- Discovery: `sc_list_sites_tool` — verified sites and permission levels.
- `sc_query_performance_tool` — clicks, impressions, CTR, position by chosen `dimensions`.
- `sc_top_queries_tool` / `sc_top_pages_tool` — leading queries and pages for the period.
- `sc_compare_periods_tool` — current vs previous period with change columns; the default choice for "compare this month to last month" on organic.
- `sc_inspect_url_tool` — indexing and coverage detail for a single URL when a page's traffic drop needs a technical explanation.

### YouTube (video)

- Discovery: `yt_list_my_channels_tool` — channels owned by the signed-in identity.
- `yt_channel_stats_tool` — views, watch time, subscribers, engagement for `days`.
- `yt_top_videos_tool` — leading videos in the period.
- `yt_traffic_sources_tool` — where video views come from.

### Tag Manager (measurement verification)

When conversion numbers look wrong, verify the measurement layer instead of re-pulling reports: `gtm_list_accounts_tool` → `gtm_list_containers_tool` → `gtm_list_workspaces_tool` → `gtm_list_tags_tool` (note paused tags) and `gtm_list_triggers_tool`.

## Gotchas

- Paid (Ads), behavioral (GA4), and organic (Search Console) numbers measure different things — never sum them; present each channel under its own heading.
- The free tier allows 100 tool calls per month; pull one rollup per platform rather than looping over entities, and use `limit`/`row_limit` parameters.
- GA4 conversions depend on configured key events — confirm with `ga4_list_key_events_tool` before comparing GA4 conversions to Ads conversions.
