# Google Ads Account Audit

Run a structured audit of a real Google Ads account using the AdvisorPPC connector's read-only Google Ads tools. Every tool below is read-only — an audit never changes account state.

## Audit workflow

Follow the steps in order. Skip a step only when the user already supplied the answer (for example, a known customer ID).

### 1. Discover the account

- Call `ga_list_accessible_customers_tool` (no inputs). It returns an MCC-aware account tree with account IDs, names, and manager flags.
- If the target is under a manager (MCC) account, call `ga_list_customer_clients_tool` with `manager_id` to enumerate client accounts up to three levels deep.
- Confirm the target `customer_id` with the user when more than one plausible account exists. Customer IDs are ten digits; pass them without dashes.

### 2. Establish the baseline

- Call `ga_account_performance_tool` with `customer_id` and `date_range` (for example `LAST_30_DAYS`). It returns impressions, clicks, CTR, cost, average CPC, conversions, conversion value, and cost per conversion in the account's own currency.
- Pull the same range for a prior period when the user asks "what changed" — compare the two summaries side by side.

### 3. Scan campaigns

- Call `ga_list_campaigns_tool` to map campaign IDs, statuses, channel types, bidding strategies, and daily budgets.
- Call `ga_campaign_performance_tool` for cost-sorted campaign rows. Flag campaigns with high cost and zero conversions, and campaigns whose CPA is far above the account average.

### 4. Go deep where the money is

- `ga_keyword_performance_tool` — cost-sorted keyword rows; set `min_impressions` to cut noise.
- `ga_search_terms_report_tool` — the actual queries that triggered ads. This is the primary wasted-spend detector: look for irrelevant queries with cost and no conversions, and propose them as negative keyword candidates (proposals only — this surface does not apply changes).
- `ga_list_ad_groups_tool`, `ga_list_ads_tool`, `ga_list_keywords_tool` — structural checks: single-keyword ad groups, paused ads left in enabled ad groups, keyword/ad mismatch.

### 5. Check Google's own signals and recent changes

- `ga_list_recommendations_tool` — active recommendations with estimated impact. Report them; recommend acting only on ones consistent with the user's goals.
- `ga_list_change_events_tool` (accepts `days`, `limit`) — who changed what recently. Correlate performance shifts with change timestamps before blaming the market.

## Reporting the findings

Summarize as: baseline numbers → top findings ranked by monthly cost impact → concrete next actions. Quote real figures from the tool results; never estimate a number a tool already returned.

## Gotchas

- All monetary values are in the account's own currency — never assume USD.
- The free tier allows 100 tool calls per month. Prefer rollup reports (`ga_account_performance_tool`, `ga_campaign_performance_tool`) over per-entity listing loops, and pass `limit` parameters to bound result sizes.
- For accounts reached through an MCC, pass `login_customer_id` when a tool accepts it and direct access fails.
